## I think, I think a lot

Four years to make a decision is pretty long. From becoming a sound engineer when I was young, to
some engineer now and to something else in the future, all is a journey and experience!

Most said I'm too old to bring a change in me, I feel happy at-least they have some thoughts about
me. Scared to death, I'm so reserved that I don't know how to express or even have a conversation,
but I just wanted to do this! Like I always have a regret that I would have continued music when I
was young and eventually become a sound engineer, but I just didn't! Most likely I would meet all
the new and strange people, that would just improve my reserved nature. All is a hope that's what I
remind myself and that's what the life is.

So happy now that I have decided today to take a break from my long career, off-course it's not to
brag about, but I just feel so happy about it and these small-small moments of happiness and sadness
is what makes life! To a better and more challenging life!

After all it's all about Living a good Life!!
