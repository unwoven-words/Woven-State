#### The Teenage junkies

A short tale.

Both got introduced to the life of wheels, clutch in one hand and throttle on other, rode the first
motorcycle together, the strolls around CP, India Gate on brother's FZS. One stopped, and the other
continued further.

Both got introduced to the life of so called trekkers hikers adventurers. Thought of themselves as
badass, but were nothning but enthu cutlets. One stopped, and the other continued further.

Then the idea of climbing big peaks together got them introduced to climbing. One stopped and other
continued.

Stepping in and out of almost everything together from early college days to entering into the age
of midlife crisis. Had a lot of differences almost every other day, the work didn't allow to catch
up often, from weeks to months, not replying for weeks was considered normal, but still held
together to eachother.

And then whole lot of things!!!!!

And then just one fine day, just one fine day, one stopped completely, just completely, and other
left to continue further....

Until next life baba, it wasn't easy to understand why and how it happened, had spoken just the day
before when the other was heading out to a mountain ice project, and explaining the whole idea of
doing something. How he also got excited when he heard about ice climbing, something they really
wanted to do together, and now the other doesn't really feel like doing it at all.....

Until next life, if such thing exists....

Wouldn't have left from Delhi had known about it. And as usual smart ass stayed mum about his
ailment, pretended as if nothing had happened, just kept quite about it!!!!!!!
