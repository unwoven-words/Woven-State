What do you call a state of mind or a state in general? The science describes the state of a matter
as solid, liquid, gas and plasma. In lay-man language each of them are differentiated by how packed
the molecules are at a given temperature, pressure and how their shape changes when the first two
changes. But, can one really relate the same principles when it comes to the thoughts which are
running inside a human mind; how the thoughts are formed, how different thoughts are related to one
another?

The Woven State is all about different thoughts (running into my mind) bounded together, experiences
and learnings. Being a quite person, at times it's too overwhelming for me and hence, every day I
resort to pen and paper, and below are very few of the thoughts which I'm fine to share with
outward world.
