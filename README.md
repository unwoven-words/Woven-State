Hello there, I'm happy and glad that you landed on this page. This is the space where I put my

on empty paper of old school notebooks and staple them together.

Now I have started maintaining a personal project online, and I just make sure I'm emptying my
thoughts there. Below are very few of them which I don't mind sharing with known people and
strangers(in-fact I feel more secured sharing things with strangers).
