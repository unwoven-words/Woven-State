#### Experience and Luck

So what I have understood during the course of time is, at beginning you have two jars - one an
experience jar and another a Luck jar.

The Luck jar is full at the beginning and Experience jar empty. As one progresses, you take a
portion of Luck and put it into Experience. And at a very later stage, without realizing, the Luck jar
becomes empty and Experience jar is full.

Does that worry you, I believe yes - you become confident, in-fact over-confident and end-up making
wrong decisions, and now if you remember, the Luck jar is now empty!

I really haven't figured out of way to handle this situation, and believe that what one requires is
to stay aware of the moment, be present and then evaluate things. Yes, one cannot really be
dependent on either of Luck and Experience, but being aware is what is required - that's what I
feel.
