## Segregation by the society

If you would have seen the movies before late 80s, there's a striking similarity among each of them.
Most of the movies during that time were showcasing a cultural or a romantic aspect of the society.
The actress looking out from the terrace or balcony, the actor strolling around the lanes, both in
their 20s, starring each other for days, months and no conversation at all. But, was this just in
movies or in real life as well?

I can't really commit about the "GenZ", but us Millennials or the generation before us have
experienced the same very thing in our personal lives. During our upbringing, right from the area we
were brought up, school and college we went; almost everyone one of us had a similar experience. We
would just stare at the female in our classroom ro around at us, pass smiles and would take days or
even months to strike a conversation.

The Indian society is quite absurd, I believe. Till our early 20s, if I talk about men, the major
interaction in a day with females used to be at home only; mother, sisters; none of has rarely spoke
to a female outside of home for even five minutes in a day. We would just watch from distant, during
school, coaching; but rarely would ever strike a conversation. We spent so much time looking at them
from such a distance that we forgot that there lies something in the soul of other person than the
physical appearance of that person. We never really got to know that, same goes with the females!

Now, more importantly, imagine about the kids who didn't grow up in co-ed institutions!

Just because of this, we treated them as an object, as a physical body; and who created this
Segregation, the Indian society; all they know is it's just an object and not a human being! Then
you would observe, where both male and female are raised together, the chances of knowing them as
human being, **इंसान**, are much higher than the ones who had segregation all their lives.

The society itself created the segregation, and then expects you not go just by the appearance, but
the soul as well. I mean how is that possible, the only thing which they did was to observe with the
eyes and there were no conversation, how can you expect them?

Isn't this a absurd?
