#### Black and White

I’m an engineer, I program, I code for things to work. There are always two sides for things to work
- either it is good or either it’s not, either it’s correct or either is not correct, either it will
work or either it will not!

Exactly! Either it will work - term it as white may be or either it will not work at all - term it
as grey. There is no grey, there is no other color in between. I believe Life should be like this,
no midways. You cannot really keep sailing in the ocean or river, you have to come the one side of
the shore.

Decision needs to be deterministic and hence the outcome - either it works or it will not. If they
aren't deterministic, one just keep on hanging on their each side. So let’s not make it complicated.

So, let’s say and assume that it is complicated, I cannot make a decision. But ever thought why it
makes it complicated? The circumstances? Hmmmm okay I agree, circumstances doesn't make it easy. But
have you ever thought circumstances are just conditions prevailing at this right moment and based on
the conditions, either one can make it work or not.

So in short these are If-Else conditions, either it works or either it doesn’t, correct? So why we
are just lingering around in thoughts? There’s no point to just keep thinking and not doing it,
right?

I believe everything is Black and White, either it’s a Tail or Head, or 0 or 1 - Like I said I’m an
engineer, I program, I code - I like to play in 0 and 1! Make a decision, either it will work or
either it doesn't and off-course you can retrospect the decision later, but you need to take a step.
